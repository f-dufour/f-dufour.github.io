      <p><strong>[2020] Pint of Science:</strong> Event manager - It started as a <i>project</i> to show Alzheimer's patients how medical research is conducted in labs back in 2012. Today, it is an international festival that brings people from all horizons in pubs to sip science together. I'll be participating in the organization of the event in Nancy.</p>
      <p><strong>[2019 - 2020] DUNE/éole:</strong> Research engineer - Is a digital <i>project</i> lead by 6 French Universities. I have been designing and interfacing cloud based digital vaults, leaveraging blockchain technology to secure and certify GDPR compliant data. Being close to the European group of work for blockchain and education means that this advances can be ported at the European scale.</p>
      <p><strong>[2018] MS-DECODER:</strong> Master student - Is a high throughput sequencing software I have been developping. Multiple Universities collaborate for the <i>project</i> and thus I had the chance to work with a broad spectrum of programmers, mathematicians, physicists and chemists. I also worked with ECE Illinois students to develop a novel stastical approcah for sequence validation. This will be part of a new publication and a patent.</p>
      <p><strong>[2017] IMMODGEL:</strong> Undergraduate student - Is a european <i>project</i> that revolutionizes the approach we have of materials applied to health by developing active, functional, and intelligent biomaterials. I have worked with the team that transformed the larynx surgery by developing and implanting with success the first artificial larynx after total laryngectomy. I have been working, as a data scientist for digital imaging, data analysis, computational biology as well as project management.</p>
      <p><strong>[2015 - 2016] NGB & YEBN</strong>: Chief communication - Part of the New Generation of Biotechnologists and more broadly the Youth European Biotechnology Network I participated in the organization of national and european scope <i>projects</i>: Forum, conferences, student orientation...</p>

      <h1 id=Biography>Biography</h1>
      <p>I was lucky to discover my interests in life science and health quite early. Even though I found the practice of medicine very interesting, I have never seen myself as a physician or a surgeon. In fact, I have always held to the biotechnology field as it is where my two main interests meet: <u>i) Biology:</u> and the various aspects of health, physiology, epidemiology, cellular/molecular biology and <u>ii) Technology:</u> as in digital health, data processing, computational biology, wearables, and machine learning.</p>
      <p>I am a graduate student in biotechnology and data science from the unique tri-national program supported by France, Germany, and Switzerland at the ESBS. In parallel with this latter, I obtained a master's degree in bioinformatics at the University of Strasbourg. Thanks to my various internships and the renowed teams I have worked with, I acquired skills in medical research (nanocarriers & drug delivery, artificial organs design, data acquisition/processing) as well as in computer science (high throughput sequencing algorithmics, statistical validation/description, full-stack, and blockchain development). I have been involved in national and European scope projects with people from various nationalities and had the opportunity to participate in the redaction of published articles.</p>
      <p>My love for science and research goes beyond the lab and the office. I always find a way to mediate and share knowledge; it can be with teens during scientific summer camps or with adults during scientific fairs and events!</p>
      <p>During my free time (and if I'm not already shooting a short film with my friends), I usually take the nearest train or plane to the farthest destination. It always feels refreshing to go on an adventure, meet new people, discover new places, and of course... taste great food!</p>
      <p>To wrap up, I am a talented graduate international student seeking for better health and greater well-being. I am more than excited at the idea to pioneer the development of advanced health care solutions, and I will keep giving my best.</p>
