      <h1 id=Biography>Biography</h1>
      <p>I was lucky to discover my interests in life science and health quite early. Even though I found the practice of medicine very interesting, I have never seen myself as a physician or a surgeon. In fact, I have always held to the biotechnology field as it is where my two main interests meet: <u>i) Biology:</u> and the various aspects of health, physiology, epidemiology, cellular/molecular biology and <u>ii) Technology:</u> as in digital health, data processing, computational biology, wearables, and machine learning.</p>
      <p>I am a graduate student in biotechnology and data science from the unique tri-national program supported by France, Germany, and Switzerland at the ESBS. In parallel with this latter, I obtained a master's degree in bioinformatics at the University of Strasbourg. Thanks to my various internships and the incredible teams I have worked with, I acquired skills in medical research (nanocarriers & drug delivery, artificial organs design, data acquisition/processing) as well as in computer science (high throughput sequencing algorithmics, statistical validation/description, full-stack, and blockchain development ). I have been involved in national and European scope projects with people from various nationalities and had the opportunity to participate in the redaction of published articles.<p>
      <p>My love for science and research goes beyond the lab and the office. I always find a way to mediate and share knowledge; it can be with teens during scientific summer camps or with adults during scientific fairs and events!<p>
      <p>During my free time (and if I'm not already shooting a short film with my friends), I usually take the nearest train or plane to the farthest destination. It always feels refreshing to go on an adventure, meet new people, discover new places, and of course... taste great food!</p>
      <p>To wrap up, I am a talented graduate international student seeking for better health and greater well-being. I am more than excited at the idea to pioneer the development of advanced health care solutions, and I will keep giving my best.<p>
